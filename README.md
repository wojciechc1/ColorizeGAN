# GAN-based Image Colorization

This is a deep learning project for automatic colorization of grayscale images using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). The goal was to take a black-and-white image and predict a realistic colored version.

The project was designed and trained entirely in Google Colab using limited GPU resources (T4).

## Features:
- Generator: U-Net style architecture that takes a grayscale image and outputs a colored image.
- Discriminator: CNN-based network that judges whether a colored image is real or generated.

- Flexible image sizes: The model can handle different input sizes without being restricted to a fixed resolution.

- Training on small datasets: Optimized to learn from fewer images, but higher resolution (e.g., 128x128), instead of massive datasets like CIFAR-10.

## Challenges and Solutions:

Color blobs / artifacts:

- When training, generated images often had large, unrealistic color patches.

- Experimented with different loss weights, normalization layers, and dropout in the discriminator to stabilize learning.

Unstable generator vs. discriminator:

- Sometimes the discriminator would dominate, causing the generator to fail, or vice versa.

- Implemented gradient clipping, careful learning rate scheduling, and experimented with label smoothing to balance the GAN training.

Normalization issues:

- Tried BatchNorm, InstanceNorm, and GroupNorm.

- Found BatchNorm worked better for stability in this setup, but GroupNorm allowed some flexibility for variable batch sizes.

Limited computational resources:

- Training on a T4 GPU in Colab with batch size 16.

- Had to carefully optimize memory usage, reduce image size when needed, and use gradient clipping and efficient DataLoader settings (num_workers, pin_memory).

## Limitations

- Trained on low-res (128Ã—128) images -> show color patches on bigger images.

- Dataset was general-purpose -> may struggle with niche or unusual images.
- GPU & resources: trained on T4 in Colab, so results depend on hardware.
